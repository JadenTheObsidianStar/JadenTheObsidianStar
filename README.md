## Hello there, I'm Jaden 👋

I code website pages for personal projects and some minecraft mods here and there.
Currently learning: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
My main job is being an Artist, so all of this is pretty new for me!
You can reach me writing me an email or via Discord: jaden_obsidian_star
